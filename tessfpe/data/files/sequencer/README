TESS CCD clock sequencer programs for testing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DolphinDance:

Simplistic CCD clocking. Start of line bias not as flat as possible.
	
Integrates in P1-IA and P2-IA. Holds charge in P2-FS.
	
Defaults to a disabled measurement chain with charge queued in P2-OR and P3-OR.

Charge injection disabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
UpAndRunning:

Similar to DolphinDance, but attempts to flatten bias by dummy clocking for 32 pixel cycles after a parallel to serial transfer. It uses the upper serial register as a "dummy load" for the serial drivers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WeHideAndSeek:

Like UpAndRunning, but with reversed parallel clocks for room temperature testing.
